## Ruby Basics & Enumerables (meets Beauty and the Beast)


### Question 1

Define a method called `offerRose`, which should take one argument named person.

When called, the method should `puts`, "Would you take this rose and help out
an old beggar, X?", where X is the person passed into the method.

Demonstrate calling the method with an argument of "young prince".

Write your code here:
```ruby
def offerRose(person)
  puts "Would you take this rose and help out an old beggar, #{person}?"
end

offerRose("young prince")
```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash:

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby, remove Belle from the town residents, and
add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here:
```ruby
belle = town[:residents][1]
town[:castle][:guests] << belle
town[:residents].delete_at(1)

```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names:

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` AND string interpolation, produce output (using `puts`) like so:

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here:
```ruby
friends.each { |friend| puts "Belle is friends with #{friend}" }
```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord (meets Aladdin)

### Question 4

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD):
<!-- Maybe clarify whether they're meant to give relationships between all four entities or... -->
* Genie
* Lamp
* Person
* Pet

Your answer:
```
An ERD visually describes the relationships between objects in our models. It helps determine structure, hierarchy and inheritance.

Genie & lamp are one to one relationship
Person has_many pets
Pet belongs_to Person
```

### Question 5

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use: people and wishes
(one-to-many).

Your answer:
```
Schema shows what our models are, what attributes they have and what their relationships are.

people have_many wishes
wished belong_to people
```

### Question 6

**Assume:**
1. Your database two working tables, `genies` and `lamps`.
2. You have a working connection to the database for ActiveRecord.
3. You have active record models defined for `Genie` and `Lamp`, and the
relationships between the two are set up in Active Record.
<!-- Do we want to specifiy what kind of relationship they have, in case some students aren't familiar with the mythology...? -->
4. Lamps have one property, `wishes_remaining`, and genies have one property, `name`.

Write code to do the following:

1. Create a lamp with 3 wishes remaining and a genie named 'Genie'
2. Create a relationship between 'Genie' and the lamp.
3. Update the lamp so it only has one wish left.
  * Oh no... Jafar has Aladdin! Thankfully he's wished to become a genie himself!
4. Create a new Genie named 'Jafar' and put him in a new lamp with 3 wishes left.
5. Free the good Genie by setting his lamp to `nil`


Write your code here:
```ruby
# code here
```

## Sinatra / REST (meets Mulan)

### Question 7

The Chinese Emperor needs an application to help him manage his warriors.
<!-- LOLZ. YES. -->

Describe to him what a RESTful route is, and list what the seven RESTful routes
would look like for such an application.

Your description:
```
A RESTful route has both an HTTP verb and a URL path. They typically describes the CRUD actions that people usually use in applications.
```
Your routes:
```
The ancestors have provided an example of one route; you do the other six!

#index - all warriors
GET '/warriors'

#new - form for new warrior
GET '/warriors/new'

#create - submit and create new warrior
POST '/warriors'

#show - one warrior by ID
GET '/warriors/:id'

#edit - one warrior by ID
GET '/warriors/:id/edit'

#update - one warrior by ID
PUT '/warriors/:id'

#destroy a specific warrior by ID
DELETE '/warriors/:id'

```

### Question 8

Assume:
* Warrior is an ActiveRecord model, with a 'name' attribute.
* You have a Sinatra `app.rb` (or similar file), that defines the following
route:

```ruby
get '/warriors' do
  @warriors = Warrior.all
  erb :"warriors/index"
end
```

Write what an example ERB file (aka view) might look like to list all the warriors:

Write your code here (**NOTE: syntax highlighting doesn't work for ERB in markdown files, so ignore the colors!**):
```html

<% @warriors.each do |warrior| %>
  <%= warrior.name %>
<% end %>


```
